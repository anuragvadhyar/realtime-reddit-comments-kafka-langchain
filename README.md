# Real-Time News Headline Processing with Kafka, Apache Spark, and MongoDB

Developed a robust data pipeline for real-time news headline processing and analysis using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and MongoDB. Key components include:

__Data Ingestion__: Engineered a Kafka producer to stream news headlines from diverse APIs into Kafka topics, ensuring dynamic and scalable data ingestion.

__Stream Processing__: Leveraged Apache Sparkâ€™s structured streaming capabilities to consume messages from Kafka, perform custom transformations, and apply a TF-IDF pipeline for feature extraction and similarity analysis between headlines.

__Data Storage__: Integrated MongoDB for persistent storage of processed headlines, enabling efficient retrieval and complex querying.
Real-Time Analysis: Utilized a custom TF-IDF pipeline and similarity algorithms to identify and filter similar headlines, supporting real-time data processing and analytics.

__Optimization__: Designed the system for high throughput and scalability, optimizing performance to handle large volumes of data efficiently.


This project demonstrates proficiency in building real-time data pipelines, implementing custom TF-IDF pipelines, and managing NoSQL databases, providing actionable insights and enhancing data-driven decision-making.
